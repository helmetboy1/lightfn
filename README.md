# Neonite Server
Fortnite lobby emulator with much customization options based on express/electron js
Since there is no way to mod the game without disrupting other players with neo , players can host their own server and be free to mod the game without ruining the game for everyone else or enjoy checking og lobbys

We ❤️ Fortnite and hope this creates an exciting new experience for the game.

* Customize anything you want

### How do I create accounts?
No need for any accounts, it's enough to type anything and hit enter
